**'Digital Craftsman (Programmer/Runner)'**

I am currently pursuing cybersecurity education at Northwest-Shoals Community College (NWSCC) with the objective of becoming a Cyber Technician. My academic approach emphasizes independent learning and self-directed project development, having successfully completed numerous coding projects through autonomous research and implementation. 

Concurrently, I serve as a member of the NWSCC cross country team, demonstrating my ability to excel in both academic and athletic commitments. This dual focus reflects my commitment to comprehensive personal and professional development, showcasing discipline, time management, and the pursuit of excellence across multiple domains.

My experience in independent project development has cultivated strong problem-solving capabilities and technical proficiency, while my athletic participation has reinforced qualities essential for professional success: perseverance, goal-oriented thinking, and the ability to perform under pressure.
